        <p style="width: 600px">One-Pan Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles – Helping Hamburger Help Itself

            Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat sauce, her hamburger did not need any help. We did enjoy the occasional box of mac and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vodka (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups egg noodles</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh sliced chives or green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p style="width: 800px">Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.</p></li>
            <li><p style="width: 800px">Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka and allow to evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p style="width: 800px">Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)</p></li>
            <li><p style="width: 800px">Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</p></li>            
        </ol>
